# Project2_Sketch
I created a project using Sketchpy and Turtle to draw 3 sketches using two Python libraries.
1) Sketch 1 and Sketch 2 are drawn from the image in png format using the canvas function sketch_from_image() in the Sketchpy library.
3) Sketch 3 is drawn using Turtle Library. (Currently, I'm still working on creating sketch through turtle and I'll complete it before Monday.)
